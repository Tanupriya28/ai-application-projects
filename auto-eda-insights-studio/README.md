#  AI Data Insights Studio

An end-to-end AI-powered data analysis platform that allows users to upload datasets and instantly explore, clean, query, visualize, model, and interact with data using natural language.

This system combines:
- Automated data analytics
- Machine learning pipelines
- SQL querying
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Interactive dashboards

into a single unified workspace.

##  Project Objective

Real-world data is messy and requires multiple tools to analyze effectively.

AI Data Insights Studio removes this complexity by providing:

> A complete automated data analysis environment that works directly on raw uploaded CSV files — without manual coding.

From exploration to modeling to querying — everything is handled in one platform.

#  Core Features

##  Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Dataset overview & schema detection  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Missing value visualization  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Anomaly detection using Z-score  
- Auto-generated downloadable reports (TXT & PDF)

---

##  Intelligent Data Cleaning

Automatically performs:

- Duplicate removal  
- Datetime parsing  
- Median imputation for numerical columns  
- Mode imputation for categorical columns  

Provides a transparent cleaning report for users.

---

##  LLM-Powered Data Chatbot

Users can ask natural language questions about their dataset.

The system:

- Converts queries into **valid pandas expressions**
- Executes them safely
- Displays the result instantly
- Shows the **generated pandas code** for learning & transparency

Example:
> "Show average sales by region"  
→ Auto-generates pandas groupby code

This makes data analysis accessible without manual coding.

##  AI-Generated Visualizations

Using LLM + Plotly:

- Natural language → Python visualization code  
- Automatically selects chart types  
- Ensures correct column usage (no hallucinations)  
- Produces interactive charts

---

##  SQL Analytics Workspace

Includes a built-in SQL engine:

- Upload dataset → instantly becomes a SQL table  
- Run standard SQL queries (SELECT, GROUP BY, WHERE, JOIN-style logic)  
- Schema viewer  
- Query history management  
- Result visualization

Bridges traditional SQL analytics with modern AI tools.

---

##  AutoML Pipeline (Production-Style)

### Automatic task detection
- Classification vs Regression

### Automated preprocessing
- Missing value handling
- Feature scaling
- One-hot encoding
- ColumnTransformer pipelines

### Model pool
Regression:
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting (scikit-learn)

Classification:
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting (scikit-learn)

### Model selection
- 5-Fold Cross Validation
- Best model selected automatically

### Overfitting detection
- Compares test performance vs cross-validation score

### Model persistence
- Automatically saves trained model

---

##  Forecasting Module

- Detects date-based columns
- Fits trend-based forecasting model
- Projects future values
- Visual forecast plots
- Downloadable forecast table
